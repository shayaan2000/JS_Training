# Todo List 

## Description
This project is a todo list front-end application that lets the users:
- Add tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Revert tasks to incomplete.
- Keep the tasks saved even after the app is closed.

## Requirements
The app is developed using the following:
- [HTML](https://devdocs.io/html-attributes/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

## Running the App
The process of trying out the application is really simple: 
1. Clone this repository and navigate to todo-list-assignment/ 
2. Open the index.html file in your browser (make sure Javascript is enabled).

## Project Structure
Inside the todo-list-assignment folder, we have: 

Item | Descritpion |
--- | --- |
Index.html file| This is entry point of the application |
src directory| This contains the main script file, script.js|
css directory| This contains three files:<br> <ul><li>main.scss</li><li>main.css (auto-generated on main.scss compilation)</li><li> main.css.map (auto-generated on main.scss compilation)</li> </ul>|

## Project Setup
To setup the project:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to todo-list-assignment/ in your favorite editor

2. Only thing left now is setting up Sass. There are two ways you can do it:
  -   Install a plugin like Watch Sass in your editor. This will let you compile sass code without going through installations.
  -   Use a package manager such as npm to install it. Refer to [this link](https://sass-lang.com/install) for more details on sass installation. 

3. You are good to go !
