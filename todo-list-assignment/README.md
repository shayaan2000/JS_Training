# Todo List 

## Description
This project is a todo list responsive front-end application that has been developed using HTML, Sass, and JavaScript. 

In this app, the user is able to:
- Add tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Revert tasks to incomplete.
- Keep the tasks saved even after the app is closed.

## Requirements
- [NodeJs v14](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## Running the App
The process of trying out the application is really simple: 
1. Clone this repository and navigate to todo-list-assignment/ 
2. Open the index.html file in your browser (make sure Javascript is enabled).

## Project Structure
Inside the todo-list-assignment folder, we have: 

Item | Descritpion |
--- | --- |
Index.html file| This is entry point of the application |
src directory| This contains the main script file, script.js|
css directory| This contains three files:<br> <ul><li>main.scss</li><li>main.css (auto-generated on main.scss compilation)</li><li> main.css.map (auto-generated on main.scss compilation)</li> </ul>|

## Project Setup
To setup the project:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to todo-list-assignment/ in your favorite editor

2. Only thing left now is setting up Sass. There are two ways you can do it:
    1. Install a plugin like 'Watch Sass' in your editor. This will let you compile Sass code without going through installations.
    2. Use a package manager such as npm to install it. Refer to [this link](https://sass-lang.com/install) for more details on sass installation. 
  <br>```npm install -g sass``` 
      <br><br>You can then compile the sass using the followinging command: <br>```sass --watch main.scss main.css```
   
3. You are good to go !
